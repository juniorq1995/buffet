Welcome to buffet, a simple tool that collects ETF data and displays metadata from
top performing ETFs over different time periods. This is mostly a side project I
made on the side to help when picking mutual funds out for my retirement account.

All the metadata will be saved to a local mysql database for later viewing.

NOTE: In order to use this properly, you need a valid API Token in a secrets python file.
